# r-examples
Some short R scripts that demonstrate some of R's basic abilities

I created http://trh.me/R/?s=R in order to learn more R with practical, editable examples.  I had a lot of fun with it, so I decided to share with everyone. Credit where credit due: some of these are modified from the examples that come with some R distributions.
